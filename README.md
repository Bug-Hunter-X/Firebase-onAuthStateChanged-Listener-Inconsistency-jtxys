# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  Under certain circumstances, particularly those involving server-side authentication changes not directly initiated by the client (e.g., administrative sign-out, token refresh failures), the listener may fail to trigger, leaving the application in an inconsistent state regarding user authentication status.

This can result in data synchronization problems, authorization errors, or unexpected UI behavior. The provided code examples illustrate the problematic scenario and a suggested solution.

## Problem
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener, while generally reliable, might not catch all authentication changes, leading to the application being unaware of a user's sign-out event. This can have significant implications, especially when dealing with real-time data updates and user authorization.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing a mechanism to periodically check the user's authentication status using `currentUser` in conjunction with the original `onAuthStateChanged` listener. This provides redundancy, increasing the likelihood of detecting authentication changes regardless of the underlying cause.
