The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's authentication status changes due to an unexpected server-side event (e.g., token refresh failure, silent sign-out by Firebase Admin SDK).  This can lead to the app remaining unaware of the user's logged-in state and cause issues with data synchronization, authorization, or UI updates.

```javascript
// Problematic code
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    console.log('User signed in:', user);
  } else {
    // User is signed out.
    console.log('User signed out');
  }
});
```
